# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Catholic Network Tools is built in service of Catholic communities. We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment for all contributors, users, and community members.

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the project, including GitHub issues, discussions, pull requests, and any community gatherings.

---

## Our Values

### Respect for Authority
- We respect diocesan, episcopal, and parish authority
- Canonical governance is never superseded by technical decisions
- Disagreements about implementation are resolved with deference to pastoral leadership

### Inclusion
- We welcome contributors from diverse backgrounds, regions, and experience levels
- We actively support contributors from rural, resource-constrained areas (e.g., Marallal)
- We provide clear documentation so non-programmers can understand decisions

### Charity
- We communicate with kindness, assuming good intent
- We listen to community needs before imposing technical solutions
- We serve the mission of the Church, not our own ambitions

### Transparency
- We are honest about limitations, vulnerabilities, and data practices
- We clearly label demo vs. real components
- We disclose conflicts of interest

### Stewardship
- We treat parish data as sacred trust
- We prioritize community benefit over corporate extraction
- We make decisions that strengthen local parishes, not weaken them

---

## Expected Behavior

### Do

- **Listen**: Understand the needs of parishes before proposing solutions
- **Explain clearly**: Use simple language, especially for non-technical participants
- **Respect boundaries**: Honor parish autonomy and diocesan governance
- **Ask for help**: Reach out if you're unsure about decisions or cultural context
- **Give credit**: Acknowledge contributors and parishes who inspire features
- **Test thoroughly**: Particularly on low-bandwidth networks (offline mode)
- **Document decisions**: Explain why architectural choices were made

### Don't

- **Dismiss pastoral concerns**: If a parish leader has concerns, listen—don't override
- **Extract data**: Never use parish data for purposes beyond what was agreed
- **Assume context**: If you're not from Kenya, ask about local norms and practices
- **Rush features**: Community trust takes time; slow down if needed
- **Blame users**: If something breaks offline, it's a design problem, not user error
- **Commercialize**: Never try to sell or monetize parish data or records
- **Silence concerns**: Create space for criticism and improvement

## Conflict Resolution

### Disagreements

If two community members disagree:

1. **Pause and listen**: Understand both positions fully
2. **Email contact@aikungfu.dev**: Escalate if direct resolution fails
3. **Wait for response**: Maintainers will mediate within 7 days
4. **Accept the decision**: Trust the leadership process

### Violations

If someone violates this Code of Conduct:

1. **Report to contact@aikungfu.dev** (confidential)
2. Include: description, who was affected, what happened
3. Maintainers will investigate within 5 days
4. Actions may include: warning, temporary suspension, permanent removal

## Specific Considerations for This Project

### For Urban Contributors (Westlands, Nairobi)
- Remember that connectivity is a privilege, not a universal condition
- Test assumptions with rural chapels before deploying
- Avoid features that require always-on connectivity without offline fallback

### For Rural Volunteers (Marallal, Northern Kenya)
- Your experience shapes critical features
- We will amplify your feedback in design decisions
- Technical jargon will be explained—never feel ashamed to ask

### For Diocesan Leadership
- You have final authority on data governance and deployment
- We will never make decisions that undermine your canonical responsibility
- We welcome your guidance on parish-specific needs

### For Developers
- Write code that serves parishes, not your career
- Document for community understanding, not just other programmers
- Test on real networks, not just high-speed WiFi

---

## Examples

### ✅ Good

- "I notice the sync feature doesn't work in Marallal's network. Let me test with SMS fallback."
- "The bishop raised a concern about data retention. Let's modify the design to address it."
- "I don't understand why we chose CRDT. Can someone explain the tradeoffs?"
- "This feature broke offline mode. I'm reverting and starting over with better testing."

### ❌ Not Good

- "Rural volunteers don't understand technology anyway, let's just use the cloud."
- "The diocese is slow; we should go ahead without their approval."
- "Only real programmers should contribute; code decisions are too complex."
- "Let's collect donation data for analytics without asking parishes."

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether something is appropriate:

**Email first, act later**: contact@aikungfu.dev

We'd rather have questions than violations.

## Acknowledgment

This Code of Conduct is inspired by:
