## 🙏 The Why Behind This

**The Church is whole.** Prayer, service, justice, community, learning, generosity, coordination—all interconnected. 

Current tools fragment this. A parish uses one system for attendance, another for giving, another for events. The parishioner's faith is compartmentalized.

This platform makes the **whole parish visible + coordinated + alive.**

When a young person sees:
- Prayer circle prays for tea farmers
- Justice team writes letters
- Giving supports workers' dignity
- Formation teaches Catholic social teaching
- Community celebrates when workers win wages

Then faith is **no longer abstract. It's real. It's alive. It's contagious.**

That's what we're building.

---

## 🌍 A Global Network

**From Consolata Shrine (Nairobi) to All Saints (Virginia) to parishes in Brazil, DRC, Philippines, Mexico...**

One platform. Local autonomy. Global solidarity. Justice witness.

This is the Church.

## ✅ YOU'RE READY

Everything you need to deploy a global Catholic parish coordination platform is in this repository.

**Go forth and build. 🙏**
