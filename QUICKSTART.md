3. Edit the config.json inside
4. Commit → Your new parish is available in the dropdown

### Add Sample Data

CSV files in `data/sample/` are used by the dashboard:

- `attendance.csv` — Mass attendance
- `giving.csv` — Donations
- More can be added (volunteers, pastoral care, etc.)

---

## **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### "My changes aren't showing up"

**Solution:** Streamlit takes 30-60 seconds to auto-deploy. Refresh the browser (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R).

### "Login button doesn't work"

**Solution:** Make sure you have a GitHub account and are logged in to GitHub.

### "App says 'Select your parish' but mine isn't listed"

**Solution:** 
1. Go to GitHub
2. Check `parishes/` folder
3. Make sure your parish folder has a `config.json` file
4. Refresh the Streamlit app

### "I want to delete my fork and start over"

**Solution:**
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Danger Zone → Delete repository
2. Fork again from the original
