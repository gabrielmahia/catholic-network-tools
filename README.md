# Catholic Spiritual OS

**Personal formation platform for the Church. Five layers: Personal (D) → Parish (A) → Diocese (B) → Global (C) → Resilience (E).**

## What Is This?

A **Streamlit-based spiritual operating system** for Catholics—designed as:

- **D (Personal)**: Your Rule of Life, journaling, sacramental milestones, liturgical awareness (core, v0.1)
- **A (Parish)**: Parish bulletin, events, aggregated coordination (light layer)
- **B (Diocese)**: Multi-parish governance view, aggregate statistics only (roadmap)
- **C (Global)**: Future federated coordination across dioceses (research phase)
- **E (Resilience)**: Faith + civic response integration (optional, future)

⚠️ **NOT** a substitute for: spiritual direction, clergy counsel, mental health care, official Church teaching

## 🔍 DEMO vs REAL

**Current Status: DEMO MODE**

All data in this application is currently **synthetic for demonstration purposes**:
- User accounts use demo credentials (password: "demo")
- Parish metrics are simulated data
- Sacramental records are sample templates
- No real parish data is stored or processed

**Roadmap to Production**:
- ✅ Phase 1 (Current): Demo architecture and UI/UX validation
- ⏳ Phase 2: Real parish database integration (SQLite → PostgreSQL)
- ⏳ Phase 3: Diocese-level aggregation with privacy controls
- ⏳ Phase 4: Global federation with encryption and audit trails

**Using This Demo**:
- Explore features safely with synthetic data
- Test workflows for your parish context
- Provide feedback on needed functionality
- No real data exposed or at risk
