# Catholic Spiritual OS

**Personal formation platform for the Church. Five layers: Personal (D) → Parish (A) → Diocese (B) → Global (C) → Resilience (E).**

## What Is This?

A **Streamlit-based spiritual operating system** for Catholics—designed as:

- **D (Personal)**: Your Rule of Life, journaling, sacramental milestones, liturgical awareness (core, v0.1)
- **A (Parish)**: Parish bulletin, events, aggregated coordination (light layer)
- **B (Diocese)**: Multi-parish governance view, aggregate statistics only (roadmap)
- **C (Global)**: Future federated coordination across dioceses (research phase)
- **E (Resilience)**: Faith + civic response integration (optional, future)

⚠️ **NOT** a substitute for: spiritual direction, clergy counsel, mental health care, official Church teaching
