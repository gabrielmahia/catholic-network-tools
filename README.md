## Overview

Catholic Network Tools provides offline-capable coordination, stewardship tracking, and resilience infrastructure for parishes across Kenya's diverse economic and geographic contexts—from Westlands' urban connectivity to Marallal's resource constraints.

### Core Capabilities

- **Coordination**: Attendance, events, volunteer scheduling
- **Stewardship**: Donation tracking, resource allocation with financial transparency
- **Resilience**: Offline-first data sync, SMS fallback for critical updates
- **Formation**: Sermon/teaching library, sacramental records (baptism, marriage, funeral)
- **Accessibility**: Works on basic Android, SMS-native interfaces

## ⚠️ TRUST & TRANSPARENCY

### DEMO vs REAL

This repository contains **real community infrastructure** and **demo/training components**. Clear separation:

- **REAL DATA ZONES** (audit trail required):
  - Attendance records
  - Donation/stewardship logs
  - Volunteer hours
  - Financial summaries
  - Sacramental records

- **DEMO/TRAINING ZONES** (synthetic, for UI testing):
  - Sample parish data
  - Fake volunteer profiles
  - Synthetic donation amounts

**Rule:** Real and demo data are in **separate environments**. UI/exports clearly label mode.

### Financial Disclaimer

Donation tracking and stewardship reports are operational tools, **not replacement for formal parish accounting**. Diocese retains canonical and legal authority over all financial records. This tool aids coordination; does not replace sacramental authority or financial reconciliation.

### AS-IS Statement

This tool is provided **as-is** for community coordination. No warranty of fitness for operational deployment without parish and diocesan review. All deployments require local data governance approval.

### Ownership & Attribution

**Ownership**: Catholic Network Tools belongs to the community of parishes using it. Code is governed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 to prevent commercial extraction.

**Contributors**: See CONTRIBUTORS.md. Contributions require a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to protect community stewardship while retaining contributor rights.

**Attribution**: All parish data, volunteer records, and financial tracking must be attributed to contributing parishes.
