# Catholic Network Tools — Global Edition 🌍🙏

**Community coordination platform covering every dimension of parish life: spiritual formation, material stewardship, communal care, and justice witness.**

**Built on:** GitHub (data) + Streamlit (UI) + Python (logic)  
**Deployed:** Free on Streamlit Cloud  
**Owned:** Community  
**Cost:** $0 (Free forever)

## **The Problem We Solve**

The Catholic Church touches people's lives in **7 interconnected dimensions:**

| Dimension | What It Covers | Current Tools |
|-----------|---|---|
| **🛐 Spiritual** | Sacraments, prayer, catechesis, reconciliation | Paper registers + WhatsApp groups |
| **🍞 Material** | Food pantry, homeless shelter, healthcare, tutoring | Excel + tribal knowledge |
| **👥 Community** | Pastoral care, grief support, RCIA, mentorship | Manual visits + memory |
| **⚖️ Justice** | Advocacy, migrant aid, prison ministry, living wage | Email threads + disconnected efforts |
| **👦 Formation** | Youth groups, young adults, families, seniors | Printed schedules |
| **💰 Stewardship** | Giving, budgets, volunteer hours, resource allocation | Closed spreadsheets + distrust |
| **📋 Admin** | Mass schedules, contact management, announcements | Multiple systems + chaos |

**Current State:** These exist in silos. A parishioner can't see how their donation supports the food pantry. Youth groups don't coordinate with social justice work. Pastoral care teams duplicate effort.

**Our Solution:** One platform. All dimensions visible. Community transparent.

## **Real-World Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Consolata Shrine, Westlands, Nairobi**

Maria logs in to the app:
- Registers to visit Mrs. Nyambura (homebound, hospitalized)
- Sees Mrs. Nyambura's prayer intentions: "Healing from arthritis, blessing for grandchildren"
- Uploads her visit notes: "Prayed rosary together, brought soup from food pantry, referred to counselor"
- Donates 500 KES and sees: "$10 fed someone at food pantry today; $5 went to legal aid for refugee family"
- Joins prayer circle for migrants
- Signs up for RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults)

Father Emmanuel logs in:
- Sees attendance at Mass: 487 parishioners (↑ 12% from last month)
- Views upcoming sacraments: 5 baptisms, 2 first communions, 1 marriage this month
- Checks pastoral care: Mrs. Nyambura visited 3 times this week ✓, Father Tom needs communion visit
- Reads justice campaign status: 23 parishioners wrote to parliament about refugee rights (impact: 2 letters reached committee)
- Notes upcoming formation: Youth group meeting Tuesday 6pm (12 registered, 8 attended last week)

Bishop Kariuki logs in (iOS tablet in diocesan office):
- Views all 8 Nairobi deanery parishes on one map
- Sees: 3,400 parishioners engaged in justice work, 2,100 in food pantries, 1,800 volunteering
- Identifies: St. Mary's has strong youth engagement; St. James needs help with pastoral care
- Shares: "Best practice: Consolata's prayer circle model—roll out to all parishes"

### **Scenario 2: All Saints Catholic Church, Manassas, VA**

Tom logs in from his phone (rural Virginia):
- Signs up for prison ministry (visits James, man serving 20 years; they pray together each week)
- Joins living wage advocacy for farmworkers
- Volunteers at Sunday kitchen (serves homeless + low-income families)
- Tracks his giving: "$50 this week to food pantry; impact: 12 meals"
- Sees prayer requests: "Michael's daughter passed entrance exam; family fleeing domestic violence"

Fr. Steve logs in (from rectory):
- Checks: Who's attending RCIA? (8 people, 6-month program, cohort bonding well)
- Views sacrament schedule: Baptism next month (baptismal prep class scheduled)
- Notes pastoral care: Tom's prayer circle is mentoring 3 men in recovery; high success rate
- Updates: Immigration lawyer volunteering free legal counsel to 7 families
- Prepares Sunday homily with pastoral care updates (in context of Gospel)

Bishop Sullivan logs in (Episcopal seat):
- Views Arlington diocese: 22 parishes, combined 45,000 parishioners
- Sees: Justice campaigns in progress = living wage, immigrant rights, climate action
- Notes: All Saints has 15% active in social justice work (highest in diocese)
- Decides: Feature All Saints' model in diocesan newsletter; invite Fr. Steve to train other parishes

### **Scenario 3: Cross-Continental Collaboration**

A global campaign: "Living Wages for Agricultural Workers"

**Nairobi (Consolata):** Tea farm workers earned 3,000 KES/month (unsustainable)
- 89 parishioners write letters to tea company CEO
- Diocese meets with company leadership
- Result: Wages increased 25%; 3,000 workers benefit

**Manassas (All Saints):** Farmworkers in northern Virginia earn $11/hr (below living wage)
- 47 parishioners march on governor's office
- Coordination with Catholic farmworker network
- Result: Virginia raises minimum wage to $15/hr

**Platform shows:** Both parishes see their impact on **one dashboard**. Total: 136 Catholics took action. 3,047 workers earned better wages. Nairobi sees Virginia's tactics; Virginia learns Nairobi's coalition-building. Both parishes strengthen faith by **seeing justice work as spiritual discipline**.

## **The 7 Dimensions Explained**

### **1. 🛐 Spiritual (Sacraments & Prayer)**

**What it tracks:**
- Baptisms (families, dates, godparents, follow-up formation)
- First Communions (catechesis attendance, readiness assessment)
- Confirmations (sponsor assignments, retreat attendance)
- Marriages (premarital counseling completion, anniversary dates)
- Holy Orders & Religious Profession (vocational discernment tracking)
- Funerals (family support, grief group enrollment)
- Prayer circles (intention requests, outcomes, community bonding)
- Reconciliation (frequency, themes for spiritual direction)

**Why it matters:** The Church's highest calling is **sacramental life**. Tracking ensures:
- No one misses sacraments they're ready for
- Pastoral follow-up after key moments
- Families feel personally known
- Prayer requests receive communal support

### **2. 🍞 Material (Food, Shelter, Healthcare, Education)**

**What it tracks:**
- Food pantry (beneficiaries, dietary needs, frequency, donated items)
- Homeless shelter (beds available, residents, case management)
- Medical clinic (services offered, patients served, volunteer doctors)
- Tutoring program (students, subjects, progress tracking, success rates)
- Emergency assistance (rent, utilities, medical bills covered)
- Daycare (enrollment, subsidized spots, safety compliance)

**Why it matters:** **"Whatever you do to the least of these..."** (Matthew 25). Tracking ensures:
- Resources reach those most in need (not based on connections)
- No one falls through cracks
- Dignity preserved (personalized approach, not charity-as-transaction)
- Impact measured (show donors what their gifts accomplish)

### **3. 👥 Community (Pastoral Care & Relationship)**

**What it tracks:**
- Homebound visits (Who? When? What was shared? Follow-up needed?)
- Grief support (Death, job loss, divorce—who needs sustained care?)
- Conflict resolution (Mediation offered; relationships restored)
- Marriage prep (Couples tracked; success rate measured)
- Baptismal sponsor formation (Teaching godparent role)
- New parishioner integration (Welcome, connection, small group assignment)
- Youth mentorship (Teens paired with adults; trust-building milestones)

**Why it matters:** The Church is a **body**, not a building. Tracking ensures:
- People aren't isolated
- Crises are noticed + addressed
- New members feel wanted
- Trust is actively built

### **4. ⚖️ Justice (Advocacy & Community Organizing)**

**What it tracks:**
- Active campaigns (Living wage, refugee rights, environment, housing)
- Participation (Who's involved? Letters written? Actions taken?)
- Impact (Did the company raise wages? Did the law change? How many benefited?)
- Coalition partners (Other churches, NGOs, secular groups working together)
- Educational events (Learn-ins, talks, screenings about justice)
- Voting blocs (Coordinate Catholic voters for justice-aligned candidates)

**Why it matters:** **"Seek justice, love mercy, walk humbly..."** (Micah 6:8). Tracking ensures:
- Justice isn't vague ("we care about poor people")—it's **concrete** (this campaign won 2,500 workers a raise)
- Parishes amplify power through coordination
- Faith + action are linked
- Impact is measured + celebrated

### **5. 👦 Formation (Education & Spiritual Growth)**

**What it tracks:**
- Catechesis (Age groups, curriculum, attendance, comprehension checks)
- RCIA (Inquirers, catechumens, candidates—pace of formation tracked)
- Youth groups (Middle school, high school, young adults—activities, attendance, leadership)
- Adult Bible study (Groups, topics, engagement levels)
- Marriages ministry (Sponsor couples, enrichment events, divorce recovery)
- Senior formation (Spiritual direction, legacy projects, mentoring youth)

**Why it matters:** **"Teach them to observe all that I commanded..."** (Matthew 28:20). Tracking ensures:
- Formation is intentional (not ad hoc)
- People progress at right pace (not rushed, not stalled)
- Mentorship is structured (pairing, accountability)
- Generational knowledge transfers (elders mentoring youth)

### **6. 💰 Stewardship (Giving & Transparency)**

**What it tracks:**
- Individual giving (Donations, frequency, interests—e.g., "wants to fund justice work")
- Pledge drives (Goal, progress, incentives)
- Budget allocation (What % to sacramentals, formation, justice, material aid?)
- Grant writing (Diocesan grants, external funding for initiatives)
- Volunteer hours (Valued in monetary terms; shows total community investment)
- Asset management (Building, vehicles, shared spaces—maintenance, depreciation)

**Why it matters:** **Money is a spiritual issue.** Tracking ensures:
- Trust (Transparency eliminates accusations of misuse)
- Alignment (Giving supports stated priorities)
- Generosity (When people see impact, they give more)
- Sustainability (Can we fund this program long-term?)

### **7. 📋 Admin (Coordination & Communication)**

**What it tracks:**
- Mass schedules (Priests, deacons, readers, altar servers—assignments)
- Facility usage (Halls, parking, kitchen—who booked when?)
- Contact management (Phone tree, email lists, emergency contacts)
- Volunteer hours (For background checks, gratitude, event logistics)
- Document management (Policies, procedures, training records)
- Insurance & compliance (SafeParish requirements, CPR certifications)

**Why it matters:** **"Let all things be done decently and in order..."** (1 Cor. 14:40). Tracking ensures:
- Smooth operations (no double-bookings, missed Masses)
- Safety (background checks done, allergies noted, emergency plan updated)
- Continuity (new pastor doesn't lose institutional knowledge)

## **The Theology Behind This**

The Church is the **Mystical Body of Christ**. This tool makes that visible.

- **Spiritual + Material:** Christ healed bodies AND souls. We track both.
- **Justice:** "The hungry Jesus will appear before us at the Last Judgment" (Oscar Romero).
- **Community:** We're not 487 individuals; we're **one body with many members**.
- **Transparency:** Trust is rebuilt through honesty about money, sacraments, impact.
- **Participation:** Everyone—laity, priests, bishops—sees the same data and contributes.

---

## **IP & Collaboration**

**CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.** Community-owned. Not for commercial extraction.

- Fork freely for your parish
- Modify for your context
- Contribute improvements back
- Never sell parish data

See CONTRIBUTING.md for how to help.
