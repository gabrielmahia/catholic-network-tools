# 🌐 Pure GitHub + Streamlit Cloud Deployment (ZERO Local Installs)

**Scenario:** Everything happens in the browser. No `git clone`. No local Python. No local anything.

Exactly like OpenResilience.

## 🎯 **THE WORKFLOW**

```
You make changes in GitHub web UI
         ↓
GitHub Actions auto-validates
         ↓
Streamlit Cloud auto-detects
         ↓
App redeploys (1-2 minutes)
         ↓
Live updates visible instantly
         ↓
ZERO LOCAL WORK
```

---

## 📌 **CURRENT STATE**

Your repo exists on GitHub: `gabrielmahia/catholic-network-tools`

But it's **empty** (we built code locally, haven't pushed yet).

---

## 🚀 **STEP 1: POPULATE GITHUB (Choose One Option)**

### **OPTION A: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended, Free)**

**Why:** Cloud-based VS Code, no local install needed.

1. Go to: https://github.com/gabrielmahia/catholic-network-tools
2. Click green **"Code"** button → **"Codespaces"** → **"Create codespace on main"**
3. Wait 30 seconds (VS Code opens in browser)
4. Run in terminal:
   ```bash
   # You're in /workspaces/catholic-network-tools
   git log --oneline | head -5  # See 14 commits
   git push origin main  # Push to GitHub
   ```
5. GitHub prompts for auth → Authorize → Done!
6. Close Codespace

**Result:** All code now on GitHub. You never left the browser.

---

### **OPTION B: GitHub Web UI (Pure Click-Based)**

**Why:** No coding. Just clicking.

1. Go to: https://github.com/gabrielmahia/catholic-network-tools
2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
3. Open each file from your build and upload:
   - `app/01_Home.py`
   - `app/pages/02_Sacraments.py`
   - `app/pages/03_Pastoral_Care.py`
   - `app/pages/04_Justice.py`
   - `app/pages/05_Formation.py`
   - `app/pages/06_Stewardship.py`
   - `app/pages/07_Admin.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `.streamlit/config.toml`
   - (etc.)
4. Click **"Commit"**
5. Done!

---

### **OPTION C: GitHub REST API (Fully Automated)**

If you have a GitHub Personal Access Token:

```bash
# Get token from: https://github.com/settings/tokens

GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
REPO="gabrielmahia/catholic-network-tools"

# Push single file
curl -X PUT \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO/contents/app/01_Home.py \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "chore: add home dashboard",
    "content": "'$(cat app/01_Home.py | base64)'",
    "branch": "main"
  }'
```

---

## 🎬 **STEP 2: GitHub Actions Auto-Validates**

Once files are in GitHub:

1. Go to: https://github.com/gabrielmahia/catholic-network-tools/actions
2. Watch the **"CI"** workflow run automatically:
   - ✅ Checks Python syntax
   - ✅ Verifies all apps exist
   - ✅ Tests imports
   - ✅ Runs linting

3. When it turns **GREEN** ✅ → Code is valid!

---

## 🚀 **STEP 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**

Now that GitHub has all code:

1. Go to: https://share.streamlit.io/deploy
2. Click **"Create app"**
3. Fill form:
   - **Repository:** `gabrielmahia/catholic-network-tools`
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Main file path:** `app/01_Home.py`
4. Click **"Deploy"**
5. Wait 30-60 seconds
6. Your app is live! ✅

**URL:** https://gabrielmahia-catholic-network-tools.streamlit.app

---

## 🔄 **STEP 4: Continuous Updates (Zero Local Work)**

**From now on, to update your live app:**

### Method 1: GitHub Web UI (Easiest)

```
1. Go to: https://github.com/gabrielmahia/catholic-network-tools
2. Click on a file (e.g., app/01_Home.py)
3. Click pencil icon (edit)
4. Make changes
5. Scroll down, click "Commit changes"
6. GitHub Actions runs (auto)
7. Streamlit Cloud detects push (auto)
8. App redeploys in 1-2 minutes (auto)
9. Live app shows your changes
```

**ZERO commands. ZERO local work. Pure browser.**

---

### Method 2: GitHub Codespaces (For Complex Changes)

```
1. Code button → Codespaces → Open in browser
2. Edit files normally (VS Code in browser)
3. git commit -am "message"
4. git push origin main
5. GitHub Actions validates (auto)
6. Streamlit Cloud deploys (auto)
```

---

### Method 3: GitHub Actions Workflow (Most Automated)

1. Go to: https://github.com/gabrielmahia/catholic-network-tools/actions
2. Select: **"🚀 Push to GitHub & Deploy to Streamlit"**
3. Click: **"Run workflow"**
4. GitHub Actions:
   - ✅ Validates all files
   - ✅ Runs tests
   - ✅ Pushes to GitHub
   - ✅ Sends to Streamlit
5. Watch it run (takes 1 minute)

## 🎯 **YOUR NEXT STEPS (Right Now)**

### **Choose your preferred method:**

#### **If you want FASTEST deployment:**
→ Use GitHub Codespaces (OPTION A above)

#### **If you want SIMPLEST (no coding):**
→ Use GitHub Web UI (OPTION B above)

#### **If you want FULLY AUTOMATED:**
→ Use GitHub REST API (OPTION C above) with a token

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **GitHub Actions Workflows (Auto-Run)**

Your repo has automatic workflows:

**On every push:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Lints code (ruff)
- Tests imports
- Verifies structure
- Reports status
```

**On workflow_dispatch (manual trigger):**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/push-to-github.yml
- Validates all files
- Pushes to GitHub
- Notifies Streamlit
```

**On PR/push to main:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-streamlit.yml
- Runs all tests
- If pass → Streamlit redeploys
```

**RESULT:** Your app auto-updates. You just make changes in GitHub.

---

## 💡 **EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: Update Justice Campaign**

```
1. GitHub.com → app/pages/04_Justice.py
2. Click pencil (edit)
3. Find the "Tea Farmer Campaign" section
4. Change: "89 parishioners" → "156 parishioners"
5. Scroll down → "Commit changes"
6. GitHub Actions validates your change
7. Streamlit sees the new push
8. App redeploys in 1 minute
9. Live app shows updated number
```

**Time: 2 minutes. No local work.**

---

### **Example 2: Add New Parish**

```
1. GitHub Codespaces → Code button → Create codespace
2. Create new folder: parishes/all-saints-manassas/
3. Create config.json with parish info
4. git commit -am "feat: add All Saints parish"
5. git push origin main
6. GitHub Actions validates new parish
7. Streamlit detects new files
8. App redeploys
9. New parish selectable in dropdown
```

**Time: 5 minutes in browser. Zero local installs.**

---

## ✅ **BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH**

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Zero Local Installs** | Everything in browser |
| **Version Controlled** | Every change tracked on GitHub |
| **Automated Testing** | GitHub Actions validates |
| **Auto-Deploy** | Streamlit detects, redeploys |
| **Scalable** | 1 parish or 100, same process |
| **Collaborative** | Multiple people can edit same repo |
| **Free** | GitHub + Streamlit are free |
| **Professional** | Like enterprise software |

## 🚨 **IF SOMETHING BREAKS**

**Check:**
1. GitHub Actions logs: https://github.com/gabrielmahia/catholic-network-tools/actions
2. Streamlit logs: Streamlit Cloud dashboard
3. Revert bad change: GitHub web UI → click file → revert commit

**No local debugging needed.** Everything's in the cloud.
