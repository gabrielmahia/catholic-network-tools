## Why This Matters Spiritually

The Church doesn't exist in categories. A parishioner is not 70% spiritual + 30% material. The Church touches people's **whole lives**.

---

## The 7 Dimensions (Catholic Teaching)

### **1. Spiritual (Sacramental Life)**

**Locus:** *Sacrosanctum Concilium* (Vatican II Constitution on Sacred Liturgy)

The sacraments are the **heart** of parish life. They mark the passages of human existence:
- Birth (baptism)
- Conscience (reconciliation)
- Maturity (confirmation)
- Commitment (marriage)
- Death (last rites)
- Daily sustenance (Eucharist)

**Why track it?** The Church's mission is **sacramental encounter**. Tracking ensures:
- No one misses sacraments they're ready for
- Families are known + supported
- Prayer intentions are communal acts

---

### **2. Material (Corporal Works of Mercy)**

**Locus:** *Matthew 25:31-46* ("Whatever you do for the least...")

"The hungry Jesus will appear before you at the Last Judgment." —Oscar Romero

The Church cares for **bodies + souls**. Matthew 25 lists 6 material works:
1. Feed the hungry
2. Give drink to the thirsty
3. Welcome the stranger
4. Clothe the naked
5. Care for the sick
6. Visit the imprisoned

**Why track it?** The Church's **credibility** depends on concrete action:
- Food pantry serves 87 people/week (not "we care about poor people")
- 3 tutoring groups support 45 kids to graduation
- Medical clinic served 2,300 last year

Tracking shows **faith is not abstract—it's embodied**.

---

### **3. Community (Spiritual Works of Mercy)**

**Locus:** *Gaudium et Spes* (Vatican II Constitution on Church in the Modern World)

The Church is a **body**, not a building. We need each other.

Spiritual works of mercy:
1. Instruct the ignorant
2. Counsel the doubtful
3. Comfort the sorrowful
4. Bear wrongs patiently
5. Forgive offenses willingly
6. Pray for the living + dead

**Why track it?** Community care prevents isolation:
- Mrs. Nyambura is not alone (visited 3 times/week + prayer circle)
- Grief support holds people through loss
- New members are integrated, not abandoned
- Youth are mentored, not left to themselves

---

### **4. Justice (Preferential Option for the Poor)**

**Locus:** *Evangelii Nuntiandi* (Paul VI); *Sollicitudo Rei Socialis* (John Paul II); *Laudato Si'* (Francis)

Pope Francis: **"Whoever dreams alone remains alone. But whoever dreams with others can realize their dream."**

Justice is not charity (temporary relief). It's **structural change** so systems serve human dignity.

Examples:
- 3,000 tea farmers earn living wages (structural change from 3,000 KES to 5,200 KES)
- Refugee families have legal status + housing (not just emergency blankets)
- Workers have unions + bargaining power

**Why track it?** Justice work strengthens faith by showing that:
- **Economic systems can change** (they're not inevitable)
- **Communities have power** (when organized)
- **Gospel is political** (not in parties, but in advocating for dignity)

---

### **5. Formation (Spiritual Maturation)**

**Locus:** *Christus Dominus* (Vatican II Decree on Bishops); General Catechetical Directory

Formation is **intentional spiritual growth**:
- Catechesis (knowing our faith)
- RCIA (welcoming new members + deep initiation)
- Youth groups (faith alive for next generation)
- Marriage prep (commitment grounded in Christ)
- Adult education (faith deepens with age)

**Why track it?** Formation ensures:
- Faith is passed to next generation (youth engagement ↑)
- Catechesis is systematic, not ad hoc
- Conversion is real (not just card-carrying)
- Adults are equipped for their vocation

---

### **6. Stewardship (Trustworthy Resource Management)**

**Locus:** *1 Peter 4:10* ("Each of you has received a gift... use it for one another"); Stewardship documents from USCCB

Stewardship is not primarily about money. It's about **trusting God** + **managing resources for the common good**.

Catholic teaching:
- Money is a **spiritual issue** (not secular)
- Inequality is **sinful** (not inevitable)
- Wealth is **on loan** (we're stewards, not owners)
- Transparency builds **trust** (the lifeblood of community)

**Why track it?** 
- Parishioners see: "$50 to food pantry = 12 meals" (concrete impact)
- Parish sees: "Are we living our priorities?" (budget reveals values)
- Diocese sees: "Is this parish sustainable?" (financial health)

---

### **7. Administration (Order for the Sake of Mission)**

**Locus:** *"Let all things be done decently and in order"* (1 Corinthians 14:40)

Administration is **boring** but **essential**. Without it:
- Masses are delayed (priest not notified)
- Volunteers confused (double-booked)
- Safety compromised (background checks missed)
- Knowledge lost (new pastor doesn't know parish history)

**Why track it?** Good administration frees **priests + laypeople** to focus on mission:
- Pastoral team doesn't waste time on logistics
- Volunteers are empowered, not frustrated
- Safety is systematic, not accidental

## How the 7 Dimensions Work Together

### Not in Silos. In Integration.

**Example: Justice Campaign (Living Wage for Tea Farmers)**

| Dimension | Role | Integration |
|-----------|------|---|
| **Spiritual** | Prayer circles for tea farmers + their dignity | Faith → Action |
| **Material** | Fair trade coffee available at parish store | Economic impact |
| **Community** | Stories of farmers shared in small groups | Relationship building |
| **Justice** | 89 letters written, rallies organized, wages increased | Concrete change |
| **Formation** | Youth learn Catholic social teaching in context | Living theology |
| **Stewardship** | Parish members give to support campaign | Aligned giving |
| **Admin** | Campaign tracked, milestones celebrated | Institutional memory |

**Result:** Justice work is not an "extra" program. It's **the whole parish living the Gospel.**

---

## Why Tracking Matters Spiritually

### Without This Platform

- Justice work is **invisible** (priest doesn't know about it)
- Results are **unknown** (did we win? How many benefited?)
- Youth **don't see** faith in action (so they leave)
- Givers **don't see impact** (so they give less)
- Community is **fragmented** (each person isolated in their dimension)

**Result:** Parish life feels optional, compartmentalized, disconnected.

### With This Platform

- Justice work is **visible** (dashboard shows campaigns + wins)
- Results are **celebrated** (3,000 workers won 25% raise—that's a miracle!)
- Youth **see** faith come alive (not just in homilies, but in action)
- Givers **see impact** ("My $50 = 12 meals for hungry family")
- Community is **integrated** (prayer circle connects to justice team connects to food pantry)

**Result:** Parish life is **whole. Alive. Prophetic.**

## The Spirituality of GitHub + Transparency

### Why GitHub?

GitHub embodies **Catholic values**:

1. **Transparency** = $Virtue of honesty$
   - All code public (can't hide problems)
   - All data auditable (trust built through truth)
   - History preserved (accountability)

2. **Collaboration** = $Virtue of communion$
   - Anyone can fork (local autonomy)
   - Anyone can contribute (participatory)
   - Community solves problems together

3. **Generosity** = $Virtue of alms-giving$
   - Shared freely (no profit extraction)
   - Community-owned (not controlled by corporation)
   - Forkable (can't be taken away)

4. **Subsidiarity** = $Principle of local control$
   - Each parish owns their data
   - Each diocese controls their governance
   - Global solidarity (while respecting local needs)

### Why Streamlit?

Streamlit embodies **accessibility**:
- Free (no financial barrier)
- Simple (non-technical people can use it)
- Beautiful (engaging UI builds participation)
- Offline-capable (works in low-bandwidth zones)

---

## The Theology of Data

### Data as Trust-Building

In the Church, **data reveals values**:
- What we track = what we care about
- Budget allocation shows priorities
- Volunteer time shows commitment

**Example:**
If a parish tracks sacraments but not justice work, the data tells a story: **"We care about ritual but not transformation."**

If a parish tracks all 7 dimensions, the data says: **"We believe the Gospel touches every part of life."**

### Data as Accountability

Transparency is not shaming. It's **communal responsibility**:
- Priest sees: "We're not reaching young people" (call to action)
- Finance council sees: "We promised to fund justice work but didn't" (calls for repentance + change)
- Bishop sees: "This parish is thriving spiritually + materially + in justice" (calls for celebration + learning)

---

## The Global Vision

### Catholicity (Universality) in Action

The Church is **one, holy, catholic, apostolic**. 

**Catholic** means **universal**. We're not isolated parishes. We're:
- Consolata Shrine (Nairobi) witnessing to faith
- All Saints (Virginia) witnessing to faith
- São João (Brazil) witnessing to faith

When all three parishes fight for tea farmer wages **simultaneously on one platform**, we show:

**This is Church—global solidarity in service of Gospel.**

---

## Questions for Reflection

**For Parishioners:**
- What dimension of my faith am I living most fully? (Sacrament? Justice? Community?)
- Which dimension am I avoiding?
- How can I participate in a way that integrates my whole self?

**For Pastoral Teams:**
- Are we enabling people to live whole-life faith?
- Or are we fragmenting faith into departments?
- What would change if our justice team could see our sacrament numbers? Our formation data? Our giving?

**For Bishops:**
- Are our dioceses living the fullness of the Gospel?
- Or are we strong in some areas (liturgy?) and weak in others (justice?)?
- How can data help us see reality + respond faithfully?

---

## Conclusion

This platform is not primarily **technical**. It's **theological**.

We believe:
- The **Church is whole**—spiritual + material + communal
- **Transparency builds trust** (not shame)
- **Data reveals values** (and calls us to conversion)
- **Global solidarity** is possible (and beautiful)
- **Ordinary laity** (not just priests) are entrusted with the Gospel's transformation

This platform makes all of that **visible + actionable + celebratory**.
