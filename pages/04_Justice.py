    **Why it matters:** 
    - Current wage: 3,000 KES/month (unsustainable for family of 4)
    - Living wage: 5,200 KES/month
    - 3,000+ workers affected across Rift Valley
    - *"Whatever you do for the least of these, you do for me." (Matthew 25)*
    
    **Our Role:**
    - Pressurize tea companies + government
    - Educate parishioners on labor rights
    - Coordinate with farmworker unions

            Dear [CEO Name],
            
            As a member of [Parish Name], I'm writing about your company's wage practices.
            
            Tea workers earn 3,000 KES/month—below living wage. With family to support, they live in poverty while producing your profit.
            
            I urge you to:
            1. Increase wages to 5,200 KES/month
            2. Improve working conditions
            3. Recognize farmworker unions
            
            This is a moral issue. Catholics believe work deserves fair wages.
            
            Sincerely,
            [Your Name]
